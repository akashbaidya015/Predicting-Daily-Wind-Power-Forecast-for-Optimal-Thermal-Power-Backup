Wind power has recently gained a significant role in the energy mix. Several utility companies have switched to wind power to meet most of their demand. However, a major issue associated with wind power is its intermittency. Consequently, utility companies must maintain backup power generated using coal, making it expensive and environmentally unfriendly. To maintain an optimal level of backup power, accurate wind power forecasts are essential. This study aims to address this problem.

Objective
The goal of this study is to predict wind turbine power production using wind speed, wind direction, month, and hour data.

Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 50,530 observations, recorded at 10-minute intervals. To demonstrate my data science skills with big data, I have used the PySpark library.

Dataset Features:
Date/Time: Timestamp for each 10-minute interval.
LV ActivePower (kW): The power generated by the turbine at that moment.
Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine, which is used for electricity generation.
TheoreticalPowerCurve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates at that wind speed, as provided by the turbine manufacturer.
Wind Direction (Â°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine; wind turbines automatically turn to this direction.
